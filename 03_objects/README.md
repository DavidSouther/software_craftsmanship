# Introduction to Objects

In this chapter, we take our understanding of programming as variables tracking
values over time and begin to add structure that will help us manage complexity
as our code grows. We use **functions** to manage the complexity of breaking out
executable pieces of code over time. Here, we start using **objects** to manage
the complexity of pieces of data with multiple facets. We begin to get an
understanding of these by building out a program which prints a desktop
calendar.

The second project takes us from using built-in objects to building out our own
objects. Returning to the trusty Rug Shop, **classes** will describe the data
of a rug, and **methods** will let us cut down yet again on the code needed to
keep all the rug types around. We will gain a large amount of flexibility in how
rugs are stored and priced, and can use this to quickly create many more types
of rugs.

The last section will take us back to video games. We'll build out a set of
classes which let us have a maze or labyrinth that our intrepid player must
navigate, collecting keys for locked doors before finding the treasure room.
