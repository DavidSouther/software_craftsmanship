## Methods

* Methods are functions on a class
* Implicit (sometimes explicit) reference to the struct itself
* Rugs... revisited

## Inheritance

* Modify a class for a specific use case
* Can add data or methods
* Can change the behavior of existing methods
* Refactor rugs using inheritance
* Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation

## Lander Game

* Class Design - SOLID
* Single Responsibility
* Open/Closed
* Liskov
* Interfaces
* Dependency Inversion
