# Functions, Strings, and Arrays

In this chapter, we took our basic toolkit of programming fundamentals and
added three powerful and useful items. We discussed **functions**, which
allow us to bundle up chunks of code and make them generally useful in a wide
variety of sitations, rather than only working for a single specific case.
This includes giving **identifiers** or names to functions for a block of
code, taking input as **arguments** to those blocks, and often **returning**
a piece of data as the finished calculation from the function. We discussed
how to augment our tracing technique to handle functions in a clear and
direct way. We then discussed **template strings**, which are compact but
powerful ways to format text in a more legible way for the users of our
programs. Finally we took a look at **arrays**, the first of our data
structures which let us work with more than a single piece of data at a time.
We wrote several functions to calculate statistics about data sets -- numbers
stored in an array.

In the next chapter, we will discuss objects which provide a mechanism to
organize larger and larger amounts of data in understandable, tractable
manners.
