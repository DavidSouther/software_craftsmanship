# Functions, Arrays, and Strings

We write programs to manipulate our data. In programming, we treat data as
integers, floats, and strings. We can iterate, or repeat an operation on data,
and we can branch our programs, doing different things based on the value of
our variables. As programs get bigger, much of programming is managing
complexity, keeping different parts of the program small and logically
connected. This chapter covers three tools - functions, ways to block sections
of code together; arrays, to keep more than one piece of data in a variable, and
more details of strings, as they are useful in many ways in programming.

## Functions




#### Exercise: Dates

1. Print the current date
  1. Digital Clock Format
  1. At least two lines
  1. Some display styling
  1. Updates every second
1. Print number of days until:
  1. Martin Luther King day
  1. July 4th
  1. Christmas
  1. New Years
  1. Their Birthday

### Recursion

#### Exercise: Fractals

1. Using Turtle
1. Implement a recursive, self-similar fractal curve

  1. Program One Of
    * Koch Snowflake
    * Dragon Curve
    * Sierpinsky Triangle
    * Sierpinsky Carpet
  1. Color the curve (distance from center...)
    * HLS & Color Spaces discussion!?

## Arrays

#### Exercise: Statistics

1. Using a given data set
1. Determine if second babies are born sooner
  * See Chapter 1 of Think Stats

## Strings

#### Exercise: Mad Libs

1. Should have at least 3 mad libs.
