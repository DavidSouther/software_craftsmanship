\chapter{Basic Types and Control Flow}

\section{Hello, world!}

There is a tradition in computer science that the first program someone writes
is the ``Hello, world!" program. All it is is a little program that prints the
words ``Hello, world!" to the screen. You already wrote one in the introduction,
but let's go ahead and type one a bit more complicated, that will get you a bit
more used to typing your programs in. First, make a new file where you have
{\tt index.js}, called {\tt hello.js}. Then, change {\tt index.html} to say
{\tt hello.js} instead of {\tt index.js}. Now, open {\tt hello.js} and type this
in.

\lstinputlisting{./01_basic_types_and_control_flow/js/00_hello.js}

Save it, then open index.html again in your browser (if it's still open, you can
just hit F5 to refresh). You should see this in your console.
