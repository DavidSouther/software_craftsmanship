# HiLo

An early tradition of computer programming was a series of video games published
as source code in BASIC programming language magazines. In that tradition, the
first big program we type is a game called HiLo. It's a simple number guessing
game, but has a good variety of programming functions, and serves as an
excellent introduction to writing a mildly complex program.

In the tradition of these early magazine games, you get the source code for a
complete game here, but it's not very functional. It's up to you to type the
original in, and then make any improvements or changes you feel are worthwhile.
You might want to change the position of text, the colors on the screen, or give
the game several difficulty levels. Like all programming, it's all to your
imagination!
