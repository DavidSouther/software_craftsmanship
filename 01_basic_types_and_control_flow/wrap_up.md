# Basic Types and Control Flow Wrap Up

Let's take a minute to appreciate what we've covered and accomplished!
We started with a code editor and a way to run a Python progam, but at
the time it didn't do much more than print "Hello, world!". Over the
past chapter, we've learned about how computers represent data, taking
just numbers and making them serve all sorts of different purposes. We've
looked at how to control the computer, making it branch and loop based
on conditions. We used that to write a program which converted our numbers
to Roman numerals. You wrote your (likely) first program! That did a real
thing, that is useful! (Ok... questionably useful, but the next programs
will really be useful!) Then we took that knowledge and wrote a jackpot
game, that lets us test our skill at picking numbers. Not content at the
bare rules of the game, we added color, boxes, and maybe even a little
animation to snazzy it up! Be proud of yourself, you are now a computer
programmer!
