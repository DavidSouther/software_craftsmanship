# Software Craftsmanship

Software Craftsmanship is the study and practice of using computers as a tool in our everyday lives.
Today's world is deeply and critically tied to the computers we use, in subtle and varied ways few would even begin to consider.
At the same time, the computer sitting on your desk offers a fantastic opportunity to parse and trove your data.
People in nearly every profession could stand to benefit from the knowledge and ability to write programs to solve their own problems.
This book shows the layperson how to tap this potential, taking you from being able to perform basic computing tasks, through writing your first program, on to having a basic understanding of how programs work, while being able to begin to understand the programs that are used in your profession.
