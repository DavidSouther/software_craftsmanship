# Installing gcc on Linux

Linux is certainly the easiest platform to install GCC on.

For Ubuntu users, run the following:

```sh
sudo apt-get GROUPINSTALL??? DEV_TOOLS???
```


For Fedora users, run:

```sh
sudo yum group install "Development Tools" -y
```

For other distributions, check your distribution's docs.
