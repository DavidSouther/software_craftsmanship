# Introduction
Welcome to the Software Craftsmanship Javascript Workbook. This workbook will
lead you through a variety of programming exercises in conjunction with the main
Software Craftsmanship book. Programming is a skill, and like any other skill,
it takes practice to become truly profficient. The exercises in this book range
from "monkey-see-monkey-do" problems getting you used to typing exactly as a
computer expects, to free-ranging ideas on programs you might be interested in
writing for yourself. 

You will want to complete every "MSMD" section exxctly as written. Computers
are not forgiving when it comes to what you type in your program, and these
exercises are a safe way to begin exploring the world of computer programming.
The exercises for each chapter build on the MSMD section, and are opportunities
for you to apply what you've learned conceptually to a program. You should make
an attempt to complete all the exercises. Finally, projects are larger scale
ideas for programs that you would be able to write with the tools presented by
that point in the main text. The more you program, the better a programmer
you'll be, but you'll probably want to pick and choose projects that interest
you.

## python
Since its release 

Python is included with OSX, and nearly every Linux distribution. On Windows,
you will need to [download](http://www.python.org/download/) and run
[the installer](http://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.3.2/python-3.3.2.amd64.msi).
To verify Python is installed and working, open a command prompt and run

```sh
python --version
```

You should see something like

```sh
Python 2.7.5
```

## First Program
Let's write our first program. Open your text editor (gedit), and type the following:

### hello.python
```
print "Hello, world!"
print 2 + 3, 10/7, 152 * 12.6
```

Save the program on your hard drive with the name `hello.python`.

### Running the program
Open your console. Switch to the directory you saved the program in, and type `coffee hello.python`

```
Hello, world!
5 1 1915.2
```

Congratulations! You've written your first program!
