## Must Reads

There is no single route through your coding career. The field is just too big! You might be interested in medical devices or robotics. Or you want to get a job writing insurance analysis - more difficult than it sounds, lucrative, and stable! Love video games? Making a mobile game might be the way for you to expand that passion. No matter where you go, there is no one book that is a must read. So pick and choose from the selection below, or blaze your own path!

## Projects & Practice:
*   [Impractical Python Projects](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/159327890X). These whimsical projects cover a wide range of useful and problems that software is good at solving. If you want to take a tour of what's possible with programs, this book has you covered.
*   [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0984782850). There are many ways to approach this book. It is often bandied as the go-to for preparing for a programming job interview. While it is the best resource for that prep, I like to look at it as a brain teazer or puzzler. If I want to learn a new language, I often find myself using a tutorial from that language, and then working through a few problems in CtCI to guide myself around.
