## Projects & Practice:

- [Impractical Python Projects](https://www.amazon.com/dp/159327890X) _Lee Vaughan_ These whimsical projects cover a wide range of useful and problems that software is good at solving. If you want to take a tour of what's possible with programs, this book has you covered.
- [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0984782850) _Gayle Laakmann McDowell_ There are many ways to approach this book. It is often bandied as the go-to for preparing for a programming job interview. While it is the best resource for that prep, I like to look at it as a brain teazer or puzzler. If I want to learn a new language, I often find myself using a tutorial from that language, and then working through a few problems in CtCI to guide myself around.
- [500 Lines or Less](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1329871278) _Michael Dibernardo_

## Full Stack Development

- [Learning PHP, MySQL, and Javascript](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1492093823) _Rob Nixon_ PHP+MySQL is a mainstay of web programming. In many ways, it is the most direct "full stack" of an HTML/JavaScript front end, a PHP application for program logic, and MySQL as a relational database. This book does not shy away from teaching SQL as a core toolset for the PHP developer, and that's a strong plus. Many other books and resources prefer using Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) to handle database access, hiding the SQL from the programmer. However, this book does not cover "software engineering" - there is no mention of testing, frameworks, or tools to assist in the long-term management of software projects.
- [Python API Development Fundamentals](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1838983996)
- [Full Stack React Projects](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1839215410) _Shama Hoque_ Covering an impressive range of fully built out "real world" applications, this book is a solid resource for exploring the breadth of functionality a full stack JavaScript application can cover. That said, I would love to see a some changes in future editions. The intro chapter covers setting up a MERN stack, which should be streamlined by using Create React App or Vite. The chapter on authentication should be dropped in favor of a third-party authentication solution, like Auth0. I would like to see more coverage of using MongoDB as a tool, rather than relying on mongoose for connections and queries. Finally, the book would be excellent if it migrated to TypeScript & included sections on automated testing for each of the applications.
- [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0136702651)
- [Practical Go](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1119773814)
- [Zero to Production: Rust](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BHLDMFDQ) _Luca Palmieri_ Rust is a demanding programming language, that will pay dividends in correctness and performance. Zero2Prod shows how to take a rigorous approach to using Rust in a web application stack, building out a robust application with enough complexity to be useful and interesting, rather than superficially touching concepts. This complexity comes by adding depth to a single worked example with several subsystems, showing the hallmark of good software engineering - ease of change over time.

- [Purely Functional Data Structures](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0521663504)
- [40 Data Structures]()
- [The Elements of Computing Sytems](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0262539802) _Noam Nisan, Shimon Schocken_

## Cloud

- [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam Guide](https://www.amazon.com/dp/180107593X) _Rajesh Daswani_ This guide is written specifically for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam, but the tools and concepts are available in most cloud offerings (certainly there are direct equivalents in Azure and Google Cloud Platform, and many of the individual tools have open source equivalents).
- [Architecture Patterns with Python: Enabling Test-Driven Development, Domain-Driven Design, and Event-Driven Microservices](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1492052205) _Harry Percival & Bob Gregory_ Many books discuss systems design. Very few books guide you through designing a system. In the same way that Obey the Testing Goat guides you to becoming a lean mean testing machine, Cosmic Python does the same for a production-ready system that serves thousands of queries per second. Moreover, it does it in a sustainable, scalable way such that the "astronaut architecture" diagram at the beginning of the project actually describes the architecture at the end, without collapsing into a big ball of mud. Part I is the critical walkthrough and should be required project work for all SWEs. Part II is initially intellectually validating for how it grows from Part I and reinforces those lessons, while being another critical reading before switching to an event-driven system designed to scale indefinitely.
- [Building Microservices](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1492034029) _Sam Newman_
- [Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XPJML5D) _Martin Kleppmann_ DDIA is a "modern" (2017-2020) and in-depth overview on a number of global scale data storage and processing systems. This includes the general and specific problems these systems encountered, along with their solutions. While it is unable to dive into any single topic at great depth, the breadth of this work gives the reader many focused branches to follow up on and go down.

## Games

- [Learning C# with Unity ](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Q85GR5Q/)
- [Beginning C++ through Game Programming](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1435457420)
- [3D Math Primer for Graphics and Games](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1568817231) _Fletcher Dunn, Ian Parberry_ Math is hard. Dunn and Parberry make it a bit easier in two ways - first, they count with silly sheep. Second, they have a ton of experience in implementing math for games, and show only what is needed. However, it is still math, and the book would be better if they added code equivalents for a lot of the algebra.
- [Game Programming Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0990582906) _Bob Nystrom_ While this book is in the games section, it has the best coverage of the topic of design patterns on this list. Typical design patterns books take the design patterns and create arbitary and often oversimplified examples to show the patterns. Game Programming Patterns keeps it real by rooting the examples in real problems from game development.
- [Going the Distance with Babylon.js](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1801076588) _Josh Elster_

## Advanced Topics

- [Modern Computer Architecture and Organization](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1803234512) _Jim Ledin, Dave Farley_ Computer Architecture (not to be confused with Software Architecture) is the field of computer science that deals with creating the physical hardware and lowest level software that allows software to happen. This 2022 book is an thorough introduction to x86 and Arm processor state of the art. It is somewhat lacking in an explanation of the lowest level of digital logic and circuits, and should be read after _Elements of Computing Systems_.
- [Operating System Design and Implementation](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009TELWBE) _Andrew Tanenbaum_
- [Design and Implementation of the FreeBSD Operating System, 2nd Edition]()
- [Computer Networking: A Top Down Approach](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0133594149)
- [Crafting Interpreters](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0990582930) _Robert Nystrom_ ([online](https://craftinginterpreters.com/))
- [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0262510871)
- [Understanding Computation](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1449329276)
- [Fundamentals of Software Architecture](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1492043451) _Mark Richards, Neal Ford_ Software Architecture (not to be confused with computer architecture) is the understanding of how multiple pieces and components of software projects work together to solve problems with large computer programs. At its most basic level, software architecture is drawing boxes of components with arrows describing their interactions. The purpose of these boxes and arrows is to eliminate incidental complexity, so that teams and developers can focus on the complexity inherent to the problem itself.

- [The Staff Engineer's Path](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1098118731) _Tanya Reilly_ You know several languages and a multitude of frameworks. You've gotten to Senior Engineer, working on a number of projects. Some have succeeded, some failed, but you've learned and grown through each. What next? Management? But you like programming, and you want to keep programming. The next step as an IC in the leadership path is Staff Engineer, but what does that look like? This book provides theory, expectations, and techniques to transition to and be successful in the staff engineer role.

## Software engineering Theory

- [A Philosophy of Software Design](https://www.amazon.com/dp/173210221X) _John K. Ousterhout_
- [The Mythical Man Month](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0201835959) _Frederick P. Brooks, Jr_
- [Software Engineering at Google](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1492082791)

## Software engineering Practice

- [Refactoring](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0201485672) _Martin Fowler_ Refactoring is the practice of taking code, and rewriting it to improve it for some criteria while maintaining its behavior and functionality. This might be making the code more testable, or adding modularity, or improving its algorithmic and runtime performance. But the key requirement is that the code not "break" after the change. _Refactoring_ is a handbook of specific techniques to streamline and simplify this process.
- [Code Complete](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0735619670) _Steve McConnell_ Code Complete explores techniques that help software teams deliver quality, effective solutions. When this book was published, it was a nearly revolutionary take on comparing software languages. However, even with the 2004 2nd edition, it focused heavily on object oriented and procedural programming paradigms while tickling at functional ideas. While the book could use a modern update for the 2020s (drop Fortran, Perl, SmallTalk, Visual Basic; pick up Rust, GoLang, Haskell, TypeScript). Still, the core premise of "Programming _into_ a languages" remains one of the most powerful mental models to compare programming languages today.
- [Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0135957052) _David Thomas, Andrew Hunt_

## Testing

- [Test Driven Development](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1491958707) _Henry Pierceval_ Test Driven Development (TDD) is a programming practice that sounds like a fraud from its practitioners. It promises so much benefit for so little cost, it cannot possibly be anything but snake oil. Obey the Testing Goat walks you through actually using it in practice for a project, and inducts you into the cult of TDD. While the book itself is Python, the lessons are cross-applicable to any language. I have used this book for several undergraduate programming courses - feedback was universally positive, and described as "the missing link to industry that our academic professors don't cover".
