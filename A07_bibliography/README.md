## Must Reads

There is no single route through your coding career. The field is just too big! You might be interested in medical devices or robotics. Or you want to get a job writing insurance analysis - more difficult than it sounds, lucrative, and stable! Love video games? Making a mobile game might be the way for you to expand that passion. No matter where you go, there is no one book that is a must read. So pick and choose from the selection below, or blaze your own path!

## Projects & Practice:
*   [Impractical Python Projects](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/159327890X). These whimsical projects cover a wide range of useful and problems that software is good at solving. If you want to take a tour of what's possible with programs, this book has you covered.
*   [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/0984782850). There are many ways to approach this book. It is often bandied as the go-to for preparing for a programming job interview. While it is the best resource for that prep, I like to look at it as a brain teazer or puzzler. If I want to learn a new language, I often find myself using a tutorial from that language, and then working through a few problems in CtCI to guide myself around.

## Cloud
*   [Architecture Patterns with Python: Enabling Test-Driven Development, Domain-Driven Design, and Event-Driven Microservices ](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1492052205) _Harry Percival & Bob Gregory_ Many books discuss systems design. Very few books guide you through designing a system. In the same way that Obey the Testing Goat guides you to becoming a lean mean testing machine, Cosmic Python does the same for a production-ready system that serves thousands of queries per second. Moreover, it does it in a sustainable, scalable way such that the "astronaut architecture" diagram at the beginning of the project actually describes the architecture at the end, without collapsing into a big ball of mud. Part I is the critical walkthrough and should be required project work for all SWEs. Part II is initially intellectually validating for how it grows from Part I and reinforces those lessons, while being another critical reading before switching to an event-driven system designed to scale indefinitely.
*   [Building Microservices _Sam Newman_](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1492034029)
*   [Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B06XPJML5D) _Martin Kleppmann_ DDIA is a "modern" (2017-2020) and in-depth overview on a number of global scale data storage and processing systems. This includes the general and specific problems these systems encountered, along with their solutions.

*   [Software Engineering at Google](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1492082791) Google has many faults. The maturity of their software engineering lifecycle is one of their strengths. This volume focuses entirely on the "principles and techniques" side of SWE, with no programming and little systems design. It is presented as a front-to-back read, but I find it works better as a book of essays. Each provides specific, valuable insight into a portion of the SWE landscape but none are strictly dependent on one another. Chapters I'd especially highlight are "1. What is Software Engineering?", "2. How to work well on teams", "4. Engineering for equity", "9. Code Review", "15. Deprecation", and "21. Dependency Management". At the time of their publishing, these chapters advance the state of the art of the SWE discipline. Other chapters are also valuable, but many are better covered by other resources on this list.
*   [How Google Tests Software](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B007MQLMF2/)
*   [Test Driven Development](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/1491958707) Test Driven Development (TDD) is a programming practice that sounds like a fraud from its practitioners. It promises so much benefit for so little cost, it cannot possibly be anything but snake oil. Obey the Testing Goat walks you through actually using it in practice for a project, and inducts you into the cult of TDD. While the book itself is Python, the lessons are cross-applicable to any language. I have used this book for several undergraduate programming courses - feedback was universally positive, and described as "the missing link to industry that our academic professors don't cover".
