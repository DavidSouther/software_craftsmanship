## Must Reads

There is no single route through your coding career. The field is just too big! You might be interested in medical devices or robotics. Or you want to get a job writing insurance analysis - more difficult than it sounds, lucrative, and stable! Love video games? Making a mobile game might be the way for you to expand that passion. No matter where you go, there is no one book that is a must read. So pick and choose from the selection below, or blaze your own path!

## Languages

These are the most commonly used & most employable programming languages today. Each has an area of core focus, where it performs better than most other alternatives. Still, there's lots of overlap, and each language you learn any amount of gives you more knowledge to take to the other languages. This table lists both a free website (usually the official tutorial for the language) to get started, and a book that goes in depth at an intermediate level picking up where the tutorial lets off.

| Language       | Usage                                            | Website                                                                                                      | Book                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | See Also                      |

## Projects & Practice

- **Impractical Python Projects** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/159327890X), [O'Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/impractical-python-projects/9781492069454/)) _Lee Vaughan_ These whimsical projects cover a wide range of useful and problems that software is good at solving. If you want to take a tour of what's possible with programs, this book has you covered.
- **Cracking the Coding Interview** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0984782850), ~~[O'Reilly]()~~) _Gayle Laakmann McDowell_ There are many ways to approach this book. It is often bandied as the go-to for preparing for a programming job interview. While it is the best resource for that prep, I like to look at it as a brain teaser or puzzler. If I want to learn a new language, I often find myself using a tutorial from that language, and then working through a few problems in CtCI to guide myself around.
- **500 Lines or Less** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1329871278), [Online](http://aosabook.org/en/index.html)) _Michael Dibernardo_ 500 Lines is an anthology book that dissects 22 programs, each written in (as the title says) 500 lines of code that solves a specific, common problem in programming. While these projects are much more focused on the software domain than those in _Impractical Python Projects_, they do provide an under the hood look at how the core software components could be written.

## Full Stack Development

- **Learning PHP, MySQL, and Javascript** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1492093823), [O'Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-php-mysql/9781492093817/)) _Rob Nixon_ PHP+MySQL is a mainstay of web programming. In many ways, it is the most direct "full stack" of an HTML/JavaScript front end, a PHP application for program logic, and MySQL as a relational database. This book does not shy away from teaching SQL as a core tool set for the PHP developer, and that's a strong plus. Many other books and resources prefer using Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) to handle database access, hiding the SQL from the programmer. However, this book does not cover "software engineering" - there is no mention of testing, frameworks, or tools to assist in the long-term management of software projects.
- **Flask Web Development** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1491991739), [O'Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/flask-web-development/9781491991725/)) _Miguel Grinberg_ While Django is the complete "batteries included" framework for Python, I prefer Flask for its more modular approach. (Rails is a great alternative, as well.) This book covers a range of flask topics, especially focusing on SQLAlchemy to manage database schemas and access. This tooling provides great flexibility across the range of web applications you might want to build with Python.
- **Full Stack React Projects** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1839215410), [O'Reilly]()) _Shama Hoque_ Covering an impressive range of fully built out "real world" applications, this book is a solid resource for exploring the breadth of functionality a full stack JavaScript application can cover. That said, I would love to see a some changes in future editions. The intro chapter covers setting up a MERN stack, which should be streamlined by using Create React App or Vite. The chapter on authentication should be dropped in favor of a third-party authentication solution, like Auth0. I would like to see more coverage of using MongoDB as a tool, rather than relying on mongoose for connections and queries. Finally, the book would be excellent if it migrated to TypeScript & included sections on automated testing for each of the applications.
- **Ruby on Rails Tutorial** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/013804984X), [O'Reilly]()) ([O'Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ruby-on-rails/9780138050061/)) _Michael Hartl_ Ruby on Rails was the seminal "3-tier" web framework. It remains widely influential and deployed today. This tutorial is up to date with the latest in Rails, including best practices, current tooling, and cloud service provider integrations.
- **Practical Go** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1119773814), [O'Reilly]()) _Amit Saha_ Go (golang) is a language that is focused on systems utilities. This book walks through writing CLI programs that provide automation and integration with other programs on a computer, and through making network services that allow computers to interoperate across widely distributed locations.
- **Zero to Production: Rust** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BHLDMFDQ), [Online](https://www.zero2prod.com/index.html)) _Luca Palmieri_ Rust is a demanding programming language, that will pay dividends in correctness and performance. Zero2Prod shows how to take a rigorous approach to using Rust in a web application stack, building out a robust application with enough complexity to be useful and interesting, rather than superficially touching concepts. This complexity comes by adding depth to a single worked example with several subsystems, showing the hallmark of good software engineering - ease of change over time. The downside of this book is the same as the issues with Rust's ecosystem today. All of the tooling works phenomenally well, but there hasn't been enough time to determine the "winners" of best practice libraries, and this book will need future editions that keep abreast of library changes in the ecosystem.

## Data Structures & Computer Science

- **Data Structures & Algorithms in Python** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1118290275), [O'Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/data-structures/9780134855912/)) _John Canning_ & _Alan Broder_ & _Robert Lafore_ What sets this data structures book apart is the adjacent visualization software. I have quibbles with every presentation of DS&A - this one I think doesn't focus enough on the concept of interfaces and using Data Structures for SOLID principles, but instead focuses on the algorithmic portion. Still, the layout of topics is less academic than many contemporary DS&A textbooks.
- **Purely Functional Data Structures** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0521663504)) _Chris Okasaki_ Taking your understanding of imperative data structures and turning it inside out, functional data structures use recursion and immutability to provide strong guarantees for your data life-cycles. They are also very easy to test. Even without using these structures directly, the concepts and techniques will help improve your coding. The scala used in the book is relatively straightforward, but does take a bit of getting used to.
- **40 Algorithms Every Programmer Should Know** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1789801214), [O'Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/40-algorithms-every/9781789801217)) _Imran Ahmad_ Picking up where most DS&A texts leave off, this goes into advanced tools for data analytics, machine learning, graphs, and cryptography. There are no esoteric algorithms in this book - each topic covered powers entire companies, and many power specific whole cottage industries. It not only covers the theory, it sets each algorithm in context and provides guidance on how to integrate the algorithm into a large solution to a problem. The code is concise and focused data frame code, letting you see how to use the algorithm professionally.
- **The Elements of Computing Systems** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0262539802)) _Noam Nisan_ & _Shimon Schocken_

## Cloud

- **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam Guide** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/180107593X), [O'Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/aws-certified-cloud/9781801075930/)) _Rajesh Daswani_ This guide is written specifically for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam, but the tools and concepts are available in most cloud offerings (certainly there are direct equivalents in Azure and Google Cloud Platform, and many of the individual tools have open source equivalents). The exercises are valuable if you've never done the equivalent, but the real benefit with this book is a menu of what offerings are available.
- **Architecture Patterns with Python** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1492052205), [O'Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/architecture-patterns-with/9781492052197/)) _Harry Percival & Bob Gregory_ Many books discuss systems design. Very few books guide you through designing a system. In the same way that Obey the Testing Goat guides you to becoming a lean mean testing machine, Cosmic Python does the same for a production-ready system that serves thousands of queries per second. Moreover, it does it in a sustainable, scalable way such that the "astronaut architecture" diagram at the beginning of the project actually describes the architecture at the end, without collapsing into a big ball of mud. Part I is the critical walkthrough and should be required project work for all SWEs. Part II is initially intellectually validating for how it grows from Part I and reinforces those lessons, while being another critical reading before switching to an event-driven system designed to scale indefinitely.

- **Designing Data-Intensive Applications** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XPJML5D), [O'Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/)) _Martin Kleppmann_ DDIA is a "modern" (2017-2020) and in-depth overview on a number of global scale data storage and processing systems. This includes the general and specific problems these systems encountered, along with their solutions. While it is unable to dive into any single topic at great depth, the breadth of this work gives the reader many focused branches to follow up on and go down.
- **Site Reliability Engineering** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/149192912X), [O'Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/site-reliability-engineering/9781491929117/)) Site Reliability Engineering can be something of a mystic art to the uninitiated. This book is from the creators of that mystic art. It describes the reasons for treating SRE as a unique discipline, and a number of practices and ways to operate as an SRE organization. This book works for anyone looking to add SRE to their DevOps toolkit, and for anyone looking to create and manage an SRE organization in their company.

## Mobile

- **React and React Native - 4th Edition** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1803231289), [O'Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/react-and-react/9781803231280/)) _Adam Boduch_ & _Roy Derks_ & _Mikhail Sakhniuk_ React is the most popular and influential framework for web application development. React Native takes React and packages it to run as an app on mobile phones, including offline first functionality, regardless of phone type or operating system. This allows teams to leverage their existing React websites and apps with minimal updates or changes when going mobile.
- **Android Development with Kotlin** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1787123685)) _Marcin Moskala_, _Igor Wojda_

## Games

- **Learning C# with Unity** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Q85GR5Q/), [O'Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-c-by/9781837636877/)) _Harrison Ferrone_
- **Beginning C++ through Game Programming** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1435457420)) _Michael Dawson_
- **3D Math Primer for Graphics and Games** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1568817231), [O'Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/3d-math-primer/9781439869819/)) _Fletcher Dunn_ & _Ian Parberry_ Math is hard. Dunn and Parberry make it a bit easier in two ways - first, they count with silly sheep. Second, they have a ton of experience in implementing math for games, and show only what is needed. However, it is still math, and the book would be better if they added code equivalents for a lot of the algebra.
- **Game Programming Patterns** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0990582906), [Online](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/)) _Bob Nystrom_ While this book is in the games section, it has the best coverage of the topic of design patterns on this list. Typical design patterns books take the design patterns and create arbitrary and often oversimplified examples to show the patterns. Game Programming Patterns keeps it real by rooting the examples in real problems from game development.
- **Going the Distance with Babylon.js** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1801076588), [O'Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/going-the-distance/9781801076586/)) _Josh Elster_

## Advanced Topics

- **Modern Computer Architecture and Organization** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1803234512), [O'Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/modern-computer-architecture/9781803234519/)) _Jim Ledin_ & _Dave Farley_ Computer Architecture (not to be confused with Software Architecture) is the field of computer science that deals with creating the physical hardware and lowest level software that allows software to happen. This 2022 book is an thorough introduction to x86 and Arm processor state of the art. It is somewhat lacking in an explanation of the lowest level of digital logic and circuits, and should be read after _Elements of Computing Systems_.
- **Operating System Design and Implementation** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009TELWBE)) _Andrew Tanenbaum_ An academic introduction to the theory of Operating Systems, this text stays grounded with its implementation of the Minix operating system. Operating Systems handle the governance of computer hardware, ensuring that multiple users and programs can share a computer system's resources safely, securely, and efficiently.
- **Design and Implementation of the FreeBSD Operating System, 2nd Edition** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00O56CFEE), [O'Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/design-and-implementation/9780133761825/)) _Marshall Kirk McKusick_ & _George V. Neville-Neil_ & _Robert N.M. Watson_ This skips academic discussions of operating systems going straight for a deep look at how the FreeBSD operating system actually implements these concepts in a production operating system, whose components power top of the line servers and are embedded inside the widely used macOS desktop operating system.
- **Computer Networking: A Top Down Approach** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0133594149)) _James Kurose_ & _Keith Ross_
- **Crafting Interpreters** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0990582930), [online](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)) _Robert Nystrom_
- **Understanding Computation** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1449329276), [O'Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/understanding-computation/9781449330071/)) _Tom Stuart_ Most books about technology don't think about the philosophy of what it means to do a computation. In fact, this is probably the only book that does! That this book does so in a way that is deeply accessible and understandable, and also teaches a number of specific interpreter, compiler, and engineering techniques, makes it a great addition to any programmer's shelf.
- **Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0262510871)) _Harold Abelson_ & _Gerald Jay Sussman_ & _Julie Sussman_

## Software engineering Theory

- **A Philosophy of Software Design** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/173210221X), [O'Reilly]()) _John K. Ousterhout_
- **The Mythical Man Month** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0201835959), [O'Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/mythical-man-month-the/0201835959/)) _Frederick P. Brooks, Jr_
- **Software Engineering at Google** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1492082791), [O'Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/software-engineering-at/9781492082781/))

## Software engineering Practice

- **Refactoring** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0201485672), [O'Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/refactoring-improving-the/9780134757681/)) _Martin Fowler_ Refactoring is the practice of taking code, and rewriting it to improve it for some criteria while maintaining its behavior and functionality. This might be making the code more testable, or adding modularity, or improving its algorithmic and runtime performance. But the key requirement is that the code not "break" after the change. _Refactoring_ is a handbook of specific techniques to streamline and simplify this process.
- **Code Complete** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0735619670), [O'Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/code-complete-2nd/0735619670/)) _Steve McConnell_ Code Complete explores techniques that help software teams deliver quality, effective solutions. When this book was published, it was a nearly revolutionary take on comparing software languages. However, even with the 2004 2nd edition, it focused heavily on object oriented and procedural programming paradigms while tickling at functional ideas. While the book could use a modern update for the 2020s (drop Fortran, Perl, SmallTalk, Visual Basic; pick up Rust, GoLang, Haskell, TypeScript). Still, the core premise of "Programming _into_ a languages" remains one of the most powerful mental models to compare programming languages today.
- **Fundamentals of Software Architecture** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1492043451), [O'Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/fundamentals-of-software/9781492043447/)) _Mark Richards_ & _Neal Ford_ Software Architecture (not to be confused with computer architecture) is the understanding of how multiple pieces and components of software projects work together to solve problems with large computer programs. At its most basic level, software architecture is drawing boxes of components with arrows describing their interactions. The purpose of these boxes and arrows is to eliminate incidental complexity, so that teams and developers can focus on the complexity inherent to the problem itself.
- **Pragmatic Programmer** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0135957052), [O'Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-pragmatic-programmer/9780135956977/)) _David Thomas_ & _Andrew Hunt_ This updated second edition has a wealth of knowledge on how to behave as a programming engineer, regardless of technology or industry. With conversations on clean code, time management, and career development paths, this book remains an excellent resource for thinking and being a successful practitioner of the software arts.
- **The Staff Engineer's Path** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1098118731), [O'Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-staff-engineers/9781098118723/)) _Tanya Reilly_ You know several languages and a multitude of frameworks. You've gotten to Senior Engineer, working on a number of projects. Some have succeeded, some failed, but you've learned and grown through each. What next? Management? But you like programming, and you want to keep programming. The next step as an IC in the leadership path is Staff Engineer, but what does that look like? This book provides theory, expectations, and techniques to transition to and be successful in the staff engineer role.
- - ~~**Clean Code** _Robert C. Martin_~~ This book is influential, but I find the advice and examples to be overcomplicated and confusing. The theory is certainly valuable (and echoed & refined in other books on this list), but the practice generally serves to make the code samples worse, rather than better. It's almost showing what to do by showing anti-patterns? See also [It's probably time to stop recommending Clean Code](https://qntm.org/clean).

## Testing

- **Test Driven Development** ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1491958707), [O'Reilly](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/test-driven-development-with/9781491958698/)) _Henry Pierceval_ Test Driven Development (TDD) is a programming practice that sounds like a fraud from its practitioners. It promises so much benefit for so little cost, it cannot possibly be anything but snake oil. Obey the Testing Goat walks you through actually using it in practice for a project, and inducts you into the cult of TDD. While the book itself is Python, the lessons are cross-applicable to any language. I have used this book for several undergraduate programming courses - feedback was universally positive, and described as "the missing link to industry that our academic professors don't cover".
