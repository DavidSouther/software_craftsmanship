# Rug Tests

For the rugs program, we want to write unit tests to verify all of the parts of
the rug classes. We should have at least three - `SquareRug`, `RectangularRug`,
and `CircularRug`. Each uses some functionality of the base `Rug` class, and
also provides its own calculations for `area` and `perimeter`.

We'll write a test case for each class, then, and within each test case write
individual tests for a rug of a certain size, with or without fringe. The tests
will set up by create a rug of whatever type we're verifying, evaluate the
calculatoins
