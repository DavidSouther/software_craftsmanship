# Polling Input vs Events

* Events are "Some thing happening"
  * User typing a key (reexplain input)
  * Timer waiting out (reexplain sleep)
  * Responding to a network request (explain network requests)
  * Something happening is external to our programt that we want to respond to.
* Event systems call a function
  * Register a function with the event system
  * Different event systems for different types of events
  * UI Events
  * Network Events
