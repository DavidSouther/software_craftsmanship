# Instuctor's Guide

> TODO Write an actual guide. This is just notes at this point.

Programming learning objectives:
* State - Values, types, and their access with variables and lists
* Iteration - repeated operations on similar state
* Branching - altering operations on different state
* State over time - trace and expect values changing over execution time
* Abstraction - create functions and classes to build upon over project time

Library learning objectives:
* Documenation - Find, use, and evaluate primary and secondary documentation sources
* Date/Time - Work with existing abstractions for calendaring utilities
* Input/Output - Flags & Environment variables, standard input and output, file reading and writing
* Data structures - lists and maps as a user
* HTTP Server - expose functionality as request/response over a network interface
* GUI Application - provide a clickable interface for users to interact with
* Math & Data Science - Polars, https://github.com/pola-rs/polars

Engineering learning objectives:
* Execution - Run programs with various inputs
* Source Control - create repositories, commits, and branches; compare and merge revisions
* Exceptions & Errors - Read and troubleshoot error messages from the programming environment
* Testing - write and execute automated programs to test & verify implemenations
* Debugging - Use environment tooling to inspect state and step through execution of a program
* Team - Collaborate on a project, in a single repository and reviewing other's changes
